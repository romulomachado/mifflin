# Mifflin

Mifflin is a template that uses all the modern tools to make front-end development easier. It includes several helpers, partials and a nice basic structure to the HTML, Sass and CoffeeScript.

It basically adds [StartaÃª's middleman template](http://github.com/startae/middleman-startae) assets into your Rails application.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mifflin'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mifflin

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
